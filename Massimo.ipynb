Massimo Dutti's designs transcend the typical women's cardigan, transforming it into an element that exudes delicacy and even a hint of sensuality without compromising the classic essence of the basic cardigan.The selection includes different lengths to suit all styles. The cropped cardigan sits low on the waist accentuating this part of the body and is ideal for slightly loose-fitting, high-waisted trousers. The comfortable oversize cardigan, which is a sure hit for everyday wear, is an excellent match for slim-fit or skinny trousers. In between the two extremes, the classically cut wool cardigan with luxurious gold buttons is also a versatile piece that goes naturally with a wide range of outfits, including the most delicate dresses.Combining different textures undoubtedly enriches any look and enhances its appeal. Massimo Dutti has kept this aspect in mind when designing its cardigans, whether it's a short cardigan or a long cardigan. Fur cardigans, for example, are emerging as a source of elegance and warmth for the colder months. However, the range of textures in the collection doesn't stop there: you can also find models in a curly knit with an exceptional texture as well as braided knit versions that double up as a buttoned pullover for the office thanks to their fitted shape.One need only glance at the range of cardigans on offer to conclude that this garment has set out to be at home in any situation, even the most special. And its argument in favour of a party look is undeniable: replacing the button fastening with a crossover design in ballerina style and finishing the design with a bow that enhances the femininity even more. Along these lines, it's only natural that Massimo Dutti's crossover knitted cardigan would do well paired with shiny, high-heeled outfits that are sure to make a statement.And, for the warmer months, the knitted waistcoat is a sleeveless design that can be worn on its own, like a jumper, despite the central button fastening. In bright colours full of optimism, the collection's wool waistcoat is a tribute to Massimo Dutti's unwavering commitment to using only the finest materials, season after season.\",\"keywords\":null,\"key\":\"WOMEN_V_FAM_CARDIGANS\",\"numberOfProducts\":null,\"type\":\"22\",\"viewCategoryId\":0,\"subcategories\":[{\"id\":2166873,\"name\":\"Cárdigans Rayas\",\"nameEn\":\"Cárdigans Rayas\",\"shortDescription\":null,\"description\":\"By bringing that extra warmth and elegance to any look, the cardigan is crowned as one of the most relevant garments to current times.

Massimo Dutti's designs transcend the typical women's cardigan, transforming it into an element that exudes delicacy and even a hint of sensuality without compromising the classic essence of the basic cardigan.The selection includes different lengths to suit all styles. The cropped cardigan sits low on the waist accentuating this part of the body and is ideal for slightly loose-fitting, high-waisted trousers. The comfortable oversize cardigan, which is a sure hit for everyday wear, is an excellent match for slim-fit or skinny trousers. In between the two extremes, the classically cut wool cardigan with luxurious gold buttons is also a versatile piece that goes naturally with a wide range of outfits, including the most delicate dresses.Combining different textures undoubtedly enriches any look and enhances its appeal. Massimo Dutti has kept this aspect in mind when designing its cardigans, whether it's a short cardigan or a long cardigan. Fur cardigans, for example, are emerging as a source of elegance and warmth for the colder months. However, the range of textures in the collection doesn't stop there: you can also find models in a curly knit with an exceptional texture as well as braided knit versions that double up as a buttoned pullover for the office thanks to their fitted shape.One need only glance at the range of cardigans on offer to conclude that this garment has set out to be at home in any situation, even the most special. And its argument in favour of a party look is undeniable: replacing the button fastening with a crossover design in ballerina style and finishing the design with a bow that enhances the femininity even more. Along these lines, it's only natural that Massimo Dutti's crossover knitted cardigan would do well paired with shiny, high-heeled outfits that are sure to make a statement.And, for the warmer months, the knitted waistcoat is a sleeveless design that can be worn on its own, like a jumper, despite the central button fastening. In bright colours full of optimism, the collection's wool waistcoat is a tribute to Massimo Dutti's unwavering commitment to using only the finest materials, season after season.\",\"keywords\":null,\"secondaryTitle\":\"Women's Long Cardigans\",\"secondaryDescription\":\"\"}},{\"id\":2141829,\"name\":\"SHORT SLEEVED\",\"nameEn\":\"SHORT SLEEVED\",\"shortDescription\":null,\"description\":\"A crew neck jumper is one garment we all have in our wardrobe and resort to for everyday looks during the autumn and winter seasons.

Massimo Dutti's designs transcend the typical women's cardigan, transforming it into an element that exudes delicacy and even a hint of sensuality without compromising the classic essence of the basic cardigan.The selection includes different lengths to suit all styles. The cropped cardigan sits low on the waist accentuating this part of the body and is ideal for slightly loose-fitting, high-waisted trousers. The comfortable oversize cardigan, which is a sure hit for everyday wear, is an excellent match for slim-fit or skinny trousers. In between the two extremes, the classically cut wool cardigan with luxurious gold buttons is also a versatile piece that goes naturally with a wide range of outfits, including the most delicate dresses.Combining different textures undoubtedly enriches any look and enhances its appeal. Massimo Dutti has kept this aspect in mind when designing its cardigans, whether it's a short cardigan or a long cardigan. Fur cardigans, for example, are emerging as a source of elegance and warmth for the colder months. However, the range of textures in the collection doesn't stop there: you can also find models in a curly knit with an exceptional texture as well as braided knit versions that double up as a buttoned pullover for the office thanks to their fitted shape.One need only glance at the range of cardigans on offer to conclude that this garment has set out to be at home in any situation, even the most special. And its argument in favour of a party look is undeniable: replacing the button fastening with a crossover design in ballerina style and finishing the design with a bow that enhances the femininity even more. Along these lines, it's only natural that Massimo Dutti's crossover knitted cardigan would do well paired with shiny, high-heeled outfits that are sure to make a statement.And, for the warmer months, the knitted waistcoat is a sleeveless design that can be worn on its own, like a jumper, despite the central button fastening. In bright colours full of optimism, the collection's wool waistcoat is a tribute to Massimo Dutti's unwavering commitment to using only the finest materials, season after season.\",\"keywords\":null,\"key\":\"WOMEN_V_FAM_CARDIGANS\",\"numberOfProducts\":null,\"type\":\"22\",\"viewCategoryId\":0,\"subcategories\":[{\"id\":2166873,\"name\":\"Cárdigans Rayas\",\"nameEn\":\"Cárdigans Rayas\",\"shortDescription\":null,\"description\":\"By bringing that extra warmth and elegance to any look, the cardigan is crowned as one of the most relevant garments to current times.

Massimo Dutti's designs transcend the typical women's cardigan, transforming it into an element that exudes delicacy and even a hint of sensuality without compromising the classic essence of the basic cardigan.The selection includes different lengths to suit all styles. The cropped cardigan sits low on the waist accentuating this part of the body and is ideal for slightly loose-fitting, high-waisted trousers. The comfortable oversize cardigan, which is a sure hit for everyday wear, is an excellent match for slim-fit or skinny trousers. In between the two extremes, the classically cut wool cardigan with luxurious gold buttons is also a versatile piece that goes naturally with a wide range of outfits, including the most delicate dresses.Combining different textures undoubtedly enriches any look and enhances its appeal. Massimo Dutti has kept this aspect in mind when designing its cardigans, whether it's a short cardigan or a long cardigan. Fur cardigans, for example, are emerging as a source of elegance and warmth for the colder months. However, the range of textures in the collection doesn't stop there: you can also find models in a curly knit with an exceptional texture as well as braided knit versions that double up as a buttoned pullover for the office thanks to their fitted shape.One need only glance at the range of cardigans on offer to conclude that this garment has set out to be at home in any situation, even the most special. And its argument in favour of a party look is undeniable: replacing the button fastening with a crossover design in ballerina style and finishing the design with a bow that enhances the femininity even more. Along these lines, it's only natural that Massimo Dutti's crossover knitted cardigan would do well paired with shiny, high-heeled outfits that are sure to make a statement.And, for the warmer months, the knitted waistcoat is a sleeveless design that can be worn on its own, like a jumper, despite the central button fastening. In bright colours full of optimism, the collection's wool waistcoat is a tribute to Massimo Dutti's unwavering commitment to using only the finest materials, season after season.\",\"keywords\":null,\"secondaryTitle\":\"Women's Long Cardigans\",\"secondaryDescription\":\"\"}},{\"id\":2177374,\"name\":\"TOPS\",\"nameEn\":\"TOPS\",\"shortDescription\":null,\"description\":\"Enjoy an elegant and timeless style with Massimo Dutti's collection of knitted tops for women.

Long coats, including the popular women's trench coat, are designed to cover a greater percentage of the body than jackets, and that naturally translates into a warmer feeling when it matters most.Functionality is one of the pillars on which the Massimo collection is based, while elegance is undoubtedly another. Together these two virtues reach their maximum expression in a sophisticated variety of long coats, including the cosmopolitan women's trench coat, the femininity of a belted coat or a distinguished double-breasted coat.While the trench coat in wool or other fabrics has become an essential piece in a woman's wardrobe thanks to its exceptional flair, this issue features other equally appealing garments. One of the most structured options is the crossover coat, an ideal concept for both everyday and elegant occasions. Women's sailor coats, characterised by a navy blue crossover design, are a favourite choice in any situation. When finished off with luxurious metallic buttons, this style is a winning bet for important appointments on your day-to-day life.Whereas in concepts such as the sailor coat or the trench coat, the button fastening takes on a heavyweight in the design, alternatives such as the smock coat are a great option for those who prefer a clean-lined silhouette. Its single-button fastening is concealed beneath a feminine lace-up belt which not only allows for a customised fit, but also serves to add an elegant touch to the look.In terms of fabrics, Massimo Dutti's selection prioritises the highest quality, resulting in garments that can be called upon season after season. The range of materials ranges from the classic women's wool coat to a sumptuous women's fur coat and a women's fur coat to ensure that premium touch to any outfit.The brand's premium women's coat naturally adopts a variety of styles and alternates classic shades with colours whose vibrancy can be used to great effect to liven up sober outfits. Thus, the colour palette of the collection offers models in black, navy blue and beige, but also makes room for long coats in other colours such as purple, orange and green.

Its single-button fastening is concealed beneath a feminine lace-up belt which not only allows for a customised fit, but also serves to add an elegant touch to the look.In terms of fabrics, Massimo Dutti's selection prioritises the highest quality, resulting in garments that can be called upon season after season. The range of materials ranges from the classic women's wool coat to a sumptuous women's fur coat and a women's fur coat to ensure that premium touch to any outfit.The brand's premium women's coat naturally adopts a variety of styles and alternates classic shades with colours whose vibrancy can be used to great effect to liven up sober outfits. Thus, the colour palette of the collection offers models in black, navy blue and beige, but also makes room for long coats in other colours such as purple, orange and green. This proves that excellent quality coats can adopt any colour—however daring—without compromising the elegance of the ensemble.\",\"keywords\":null,\"secondaryTitle\":\"Trench Coats and Gabardines for Women\",\"secondaryDescription\":\"\"}},{\"id\":2067227,\"name\":\"LEATHER JACKETS\",\"nameEn\":\"LEATHER JACKETS\",\"shortDescription\":null,\"description\":\"Massimo Dutti presents its women's leather jackets, which form an attractive ensemble thanks to the high-quality materials used in their tailoring, including the exquisite Nappa leather jacket. The use of premium leather makes the brand's leather jacket an excellent investment, as it is the only way to guarantee unsurpassed durability and feel. However, the use of the best leather must go hand in hand with a design to match. This is why the collection also makes the most of classic silhouettes as is evident in the flattering leather trench coat with its characteristic belt or the must-have blazers in this luxurious fabric; which are perfect for pairing with the most elegant garments and shoes in any wardrobe.The collection covers every style, from the clean-lined fur coat tailored for a minimalist aesthetic to a women's biker jacket with a lapel collar and zips for a look that's as striking as it is refined. Women's leather jackets remain one of the most popular items of clothing season after season, a feat that is no coincidence. The concept has the potential to solve almost any look and has that universal charm that's impossible to resist. In addition, it can adopt a variety of design details with great fluidity, including materials such as sheepskin. As well as elevating the warmth of a look, the sheepskin jacket also proves that, when it comes to distinction, subtlety is always the smartest strategy.Long versions also claim their place in this selection in the form of the fur trench coat, with its traditional design for a timeless look. As a rule, all coats that come down below the thigh add a sumptuous touch to the styling, as shown by the long fur coat. While this piece not only stands out for its ability to keep you warm on colder days, it also exudes a natural elegance thanks to the brand's aesthetic codes. And when it comes to short down jackets, the quilted fur jacket never disappoints, whether it tops off a jumper and jeans look or over an exquisite silk strapless dress.Halfway between a shirt and a jacket, the leather overshirt has earned its place in the spotlight. An essential in a woman's wardrobe, this garment can be worn over shirts, jumpers, party tops and even with nothing underneath.

This Massimo Dutti's collection has a wide range of sizes to offer a perfect fit for every silhouette.There are different types of jackets that come together under the same leitmotif: elegance. From a comfortable cotton jacket to an iconic leather jacket, each garment exudes the unmistakable signature of Massimo Dutti.Among the more casual retro looks is the iconic leather bomber jacket. This piece has been crafted with an elevated style in mind, making it distinctive yet easy to wear alongside many different ensembles. Perfect for layering with both warm and light, casual or more sophisticated looks, or worn over jumpers and sweatshirts, it accentuates its dynamic look and creates an outfit ready for any occasion. When paired over a shirt or blouse, the bomber jacket adds an edge to professional attires.One design that maintains its status as a must-have in any wardrobe —whether it's for men or women— is the leather biker jacket. Its bold design is surprisingly versatile, and in fact, the leather jacket is equally at home with delicate dresses, fine accessories and high-heeled sandals, as it is with suit trousers and basic T-shirts. It's more contemporary interpretation, the oversized biker jacket, is perfect for wearing over skirts and slim-fit dresses, creating a harmonious balance of silhouettes.Practicality and sophistication merge in functional designs without losing any style. The down quilted jacket is that option that always rises to the occasion, no matter how cold it gets. On a sportier side, the hooded version of the quilted jacket adds an even more casual element that makes it the perfect disruptive tool to any formal look.On the more stylish side of warmer garments, we have two essential pieces. On the one hand, the quilted bomber jacket has been designed to add a subtle edge to any casual look, similar to the feel of the quilted leather jacket. On the other hand, the quilted lined jacket exudes strength and personality, making it perfect to wear with delicate, feminine pieces thanks to the contrasting styles and fabrics.Massimo Dutti's women's jackets not only fulfil their function as outerwear, but they also have the power to elevate any look thanks to their perfect design and the quality of their materials.\",\"keywords\":null,\"secondaryTitle\":\"Stylish, essential and waterproof jackets for women\",\"secondaryDescription\":\"\"}},{\"id\":2163376,\"name\":\"COATS\",\"nameEn\":\"COATS\",\"shortDescription\":null,\"description\":\"<strong>Coats</strong> form a fundamental part of any wardrobe.

This is what the basic long sleeve T-shirt is all about, and Massimo Dutti features designs that are carefully crafted from premium materials to achieve the best results for strong, durable and, above all, stylish wardrobe-basics. When temperatures drop, long-sleeved cotton T-shirts are a great ally as the fibres are a natural thermal insulator. Turtlenecks protect the neck area that is usually left uncovered in the other designs for extra warmth in order to keep the cold at bay. In addition, simply add a scarf for the ultimate winter look to further enhance the effect. Keep in mind that depending on which style you are going for, a plain scarf with a plain shirt in similar tones will help you create a cohesive and sophisticated look. And, in contrast, when paired with a printed accessory it adds variety to the outfit and the unified background of the T-shirt makes sure that the colours of the scarf are well integrated into the outfit.\\n\\nHowever, they don't always need to be paired with other garments: with the right accessories, this piece has the ability to create casual outfits with a minimalist aesthetic that never goes out of style. In addition, there are other options such as the long-sleeved ribbed T-shirt that add texture and create a visual effect with more depth, and dimension, therefore making any outfit more eye-catching regardless of how casual it may be.\\n\\nWhen it comes to eye-catching looks, the semi-sheer long-sleeved T-shirt does not go unnoticed. Made from a thin, figure-hugging fabric, this option lends a sensual touch to outfits that can be accentuated with a hint of elegant lingerie for a casual festive occasion or just the opposite. For a more subtle look simply add a waistcoat or top over it—so that the sheer fabric is only partially visible—or a tank top underneath.

This is what the basic long sleeve T-shirt is all about, and Massimo Dutti features designs that are carefully crafted from premium materials to achieve the best results for strong, durable and, above all, stylish wardrobe-basics. When temperatures drop, long-sleeved cotton T-shirts are a great ally as the fibres are a natural thermal insulator. Turtlenecks protect the neck area that is usually left uncovered in the other designs for extra warmth in order to keep the cold at bay. In addition, simply add a scarf for the ultimate winter look to further enhance the effect. Keep in mind that depending on which style you are going for, a plain scarf with a plain shirt in similar tones will help you create a cohesive and sophisticated look. And, in contrast, when paired with a printed accessory it adds variety to the outfit and the unified background of the T-shirt makes sure that the colours of the scarf are well integrated into the outfit.\\n\\nHowever, they don't always need to be paired with other garments: with the right accessories, this piece has the ability to create casual outfits with a minimalist aesthetic that never goes out of style. In addition, there are other options such as the long-sleeved ribbed T-shirt that add texture and create a visual effect with more depth, and dimension, therefore making any outfit more eye-catching regardless of how casual it may be.\\n\\nWhen it comes to eye-catching looks, the semi-sheer long-sleeved T-shirt does not go unnoticed. Made from a thin, figure-hugging fabric, this option lends a sensual touch to outfits that can be accentuated with a hint of elegant lingerie for a casual festive occasion or just the opposite. For a more subtle look simply add a waistcoat or top over it—so that the sheer fabric is only partially visible—or a tank top underneath.

The Massimo Dutti women's collection includes a wide selection of linen dresses that adapt to different situations arising both daily and on special occasions.

In fact, linen dresses make an ideal bet for wedding occasions, a choice that will maintain the standard of sophistication at the height of circumstances while guaranteeing an epic appearance no matter how high the temperatures are. In the same way, linen party dresses fit perfectly into social events, especially if those are held during the daytime and enjoyed in the outdoors. Although of course, they can easily flow from day to night with corresponding complements. If by daytime the garment is accompanied by some sunglasses, wedge sandals, and a hat that adds a unique touch and at the same time protects from sun exposure, at night it could be combined with thin-heeled sandals, a handbag that stands out and your hair up in a bun. Among favourite summer linen dress options, long linen dress designs can show intense and subtle flair, depending on their silhouette and print. Or, on the contrary, transmit a cheerful energy that permeates the looks with a carefree touch, totally fit for natural environments.

In this edit,&nbsp;<strong>Massimo Dutti's dresses</strong> are always marked by elegance, with flattering, flowing silhouettes and quality fabrics.<br><br>&nbsp;From the New York of the 80's, <strong>long dresses&nbsp;</strong>paired with trainers are still very much on-trend today, season after season, for their comfortable, urban-chic aesthetic. Southern American also returns in the form of <strong>dresses</strong> paired with short boots, a combination reminiscent of bohemian Californian styles. The key to the success of this ensemble is precisely the harmony created between the more forceful type of footwear in contrast with a delicate garment such as the&nbsp;<strong>flowing dress</strong>.&nbsp;<br><br>This collection features contrasting fabrics and textures: from the freshness and lightness of softer fabrics to the warmth and robustness of more full-bodied materials. For the former, we present the long linen and <strong>long silk dresses</strong> —both of which are considered to be the epitome of sophistication and go perfectly with <strong>sandals</strong> or<strong>&nbsp;ankle boots and practical handbags</strong> of any size. Meanwhile, the long <strong>poplin dress</strong> offers a totally versatile, day-to-day option suitable for any season. Moreover, it is easy to complement with other warmer or lighter garments, embracing the role of formality just as well when paired with more sober garments. Other models adaptable to a multitude of styles and looks are the knit dress and the&nbsp;<strong>cashmere dress</strong>.<br><br>Their soft textures make their quality evident at first glance, making it possible to create minimalist outfits in which less is more when it comes to a garment with an impeccable appearance. On the other hand, the more cosmopolitan designs include the <strong>long leather dress</strong> and the <strong>short dress</strong>, also<strong>&nbsp;in leather</strong>. In particular, the&nbsp;<strong>short black dress</strong> in this material has a particularly trendy character with a silhouette that does not disappoint, completely flattering and adaptable for strong and stylish looks.<br><br>&nbsp;For a more professional approach one can find a wide variety of available alternatives. For example, the <strong>long shirt dress</strong> is a simple yet comfortable choice <strong>suitable for office looks&nbsp;</strong>while the&nbsp;<strong>blazer dress</strong> is one of the best examples of elegance, and can be worn not only to business meetings but also to professional events and parties where you want to make a statement. &nbsp;<br><br>Meanwhile, the long cross over dress —whether long or short sleeved— undeniably flatters the silhouette with a relaxed sophistication appropriate for such occasions. For this edit, the most romantic pieces are presented in dresses from the 70s. The<strong>&nbsp;long printed</strong>, <strong>strapless and halter-neck dresses</strong> have a boho feel to them, giving the looks that nostalgic vintage touch. Recovering designs from other decades, we also find the <strong>pleated dress,</strong> a historical garment inspired by fashion and glamour icons, which today continues to create ultra-feminine looks.\",\"keywords\":null,\"secondaryTitle\":\"Elegant and casual dresses for women\",\"secondaryDescription\":\"\"}},{\"id\":2028527,\"name\":\"TOPS\",\"nameEn\":\"TOPS\",\"shortDescription\":null,\"description\":\"From fluid designs to denim pieces, there's a style formula to suit every type of shirt. The latest collection designs not only feature plain shirts, but also details such as pockets or mao collars, and fabrics such as suede or poplin. Shirts and T-shirts can be combined in both day-to-day and smart outfits. With a masculine pattern, from an off the shoulders style to knotted sleeves, the shirt is the most classic garment in any wardrobe. But if there is one piece that is reinvented in silhouettes and details, it is the blouse. Massimo Dutti's latest collection features a crochet blouse for women, with a handmade look of intertwined threads, perfect for overcoming any stylistic problem with a touch of originality.\\n\\n\\nThe white shirt is the quintessential go-to garment. At the other end of the spectrum, the black shirt is also a classic piece that goes with everything. Paired with a skirt or trousers, the blue shirt is an essential garment that suits any woman, whether in the masculine aesthetic to create business looks or to create preppy ensembles.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the plain shirt is a basic wardrobe staple that can be integrated into a wide variety of outfits in countless ways. The latest collection also includes printed shirts, a masterful choice to liven up any look in the blink of an eye.\\n\\nWhen it comes to fabrics, poplin remains one of the most popular fabrics on the market. With a soft and defined look, suitable for both casual and business looks, a poplin shirt is the best companion for everyday wear. The striped poplin shirt goes great with both smart and casual looks, depending on the occasion.\\n\\nMassimo Dutti presents the silk shirt, a classic piece that has the potential to become the centrepiece of any woman's wardrobe and add a touch of sophistication. A linen shirt is a timeless and functional garment, perfect for a minimalist but stylish office look. Made from the same natural fabric —which stands out for its comfort and particular charm— a linen blouse can become the centrepiece of most women's outfits.\\n\\nWith its flowing, ethereal design, a sheer shirt gives character and poise to an outfit that is as simple as it is elegant. For more romantic looks, pair a flowing blouse with jeans and stilettos to create the perfect combination.\\n\\nA V-neck shirt has the power to refine a classic look and give it a touch of finesse and sophistication. Massimo Dutti's selection also includes a mao collar shirt, a garment capable of elevating any outfit, especially those with more basic pieces, such as a pair of straight-cut jeans. A shirt with pockets is an unmistakable icon of comfort and sophistication alike, making it an effortless outfit for day or night.\\n\\nLeather shirts never go unnoticed and have the ability to finish off any look with a touch of flair. Likewise, a suede shirt adapts to any style with its straight and simple cuts because its fabric is part of its charm. On the other hand, one of the most versatile pieces is the denim shirt, perfect for any time of the year.

For more romantic looks, pair a flowing blouse with jeans and stilettos to create the perfect combination.\\n\\nA V-neck shirt has the power to refine a classic look and give it a touch of finesse and sophistication. Massimo Dutti's selection also includes a mao collar shirt, a garment capable of elevating any outfit, especially those with more basic pieces, such as a pair of straight-cut jeans. A shirt with pockets is an unmistakable icon of comfort and sophistication alike, making it an effortless outfit for day or night.\\n\\nLeather shirts never go unnoticed and have the ability to finish off any look with a touch of flair. Likewise, a suede shirt adapts to any style with its straight and simple cuts because its fabric is part of its charm. On the other hand, one of the most versatile pieces is the denim shirt, perfect for any time of the year.

The garments forming this collection are perfect to combine with more classic outfits, yet also with the most sophisticated, bringing touches of distinction and unique flair to any look. These pieces have been reinvented in a more modern way with different textures and colours to give the office look and more casual styles a 180-degree turning. Linen Bermuda shorts are an ideal option for elevating a style with a touch of freshness. If there is something that makes this lightweight and functional natural fibre special, it is the wide variety of characteristics that have the power of captivating at first sight. Its exquisite simplicity lends precision to making it a tremendously infallible garment. Among the options proposed in this collection, are flattering silhouettes that will become the best allies for any woman who equally appreciates sophistication and comfort. Another material that has become one of this item's great allies is leather. In addition to splurging style, leather Bermuda shorts can also be adapted to any occasion, from the most casual to the most elegant outfits. From more fitted Bermuda shorts to baggy ones, this piece fits any time of the year while its functionality remains constant. Leather Bermuda shorts will become the centre of attention when combined with a minimalist T-shirt and accessories that stand out from the rest of the outfit: creating a perfect style formula that places a safe bet on this garment. The incorporation of details makes this garment a very successful option for everyday life. Button-up Bermuda shorts combined with a simple blouse will become the ideal look for going to the office. When paired with a blazer that adds a touch of elegance, this combination will become a worthy and honourable outfit. If combined with a top of the same colour, belted Bermuda shorts manage to create an optical illusion of wearing a jumpsuit, maintaining the harmony of the outfit.

Beyond their incomparable comfort, these trousers have the gift of visually lengthening the legs, conferring a stylish and flattering stature to their wearer. Wide-leg jeans fit within different styles, from the sportiest scenario to the most formal one. For those who delight in simplicity and neutral tone palettes, wide-leg jeans are the ideal choice with which a wide variety of outfits can be composed. On one hand, you may opt for a smarter style in classic black, white, or beige, and combine it with a halter neck bodysuit, a blazer, and your desired accessories. Or, if a sublime monochromatic look is pursued, Massimo Dutti's navy blue linen wide-leg suit trousers that have a denim effect will display their charm when crowned by a matching waistcoat to complete the outfit. The magic of this garment lies in its ability to transform any outfit into something more. When it comes to combining wide-leg jeans, one must let the imagination run wild. For a casual look, combining them with a loose-knit T-shirt that falls on the skin and white trainers will achieve freshness and lightness when walking. On the other hand, if you are looking to dazzle in more elegant events, a flowing blouse with very colourful prints and high heels that style the silhouette is the best choice.

Crafted from exclusive materials, they are easy to mix and match.\",\"mainHeader\":\"Women's Jeans\",\"longDescription\":\"Massimo Dutti women's jeans are a guarantee of comfort even on the most demanding of days. Moreover, they offer the most flattering versions of each type of cut to reflect the natural elegance of the brand's aesthetic codes. From straight-cut and slim jeans with a timeless vibe, to flared and bootcut jeans with a subtle retro touch, to wide-leg jeans in culotte style, the selection offers a wide range of silhouettes to suit all preferences. The popular high-waisted skinny jeans with their shaping effect, take on both straight and flare-fit shapes, reinforcing their presence in the collection and broadening their appeal.\\n\\nFor instance, there is the ankle-high slit jeans and crop jeans, featuring an ankle style that strategically halts at the calf level, which has a slimming effect and creates the illusion of longer legs. While both of these details initially give off a slightly more casual vibe than conventional skinny jeans, they work just as well with a T-shirt and trainers as they do with a smart blazer and heels of all sorts—making them an everyday staple from Monday to Sunday.\\n\\nOur selection includes every conceivable style for this garment, bringing refinement to any of its versions, whether it's a baggy pair of jeans, skinny jeans or timeless denim shorts. Moreover, the denim Bermuda shorts is a concept that patiently awaits the arrival of the warmer months to steal the spotlight. Exuding femininity thanks to its high rise and the attention it draws from one of the most sensual parts of the body, this piece allows for multiple combinations depending on what the occasion calls for.\\n\\nIn terms of the way women's jeans look on the body, the height of the waist is just as important as the shape of the leg. For this reason, Massimo Dutti also pays special attention when it comes to this factor, providing an optimal fit for both women who love high-waisted jeans and those who prefer medium-waisted jeans. And what should be taken into account when choosing one style or the other for a particular look? The main thing is that high-waisted jeans accentuate the length of the legs, while low-rise jeans sit a little lower, on more neutral ground. However, Massimo Dutti's cropped styles are proof that mid-rise jeans can also create a very slim leg.\\n\\nFeaturing a range of colours, this collection's women's jeans come in a variety of timeless shades. From classic blue jeans to white jeans for sunny days, from versatile grey jeans to black jeans for an eye-catching all-black look.\",\"keywords\":null,\"secondaryTitle\":\"Jeans for Women\",\"secondaryDescription\":\"\"}},{\"id\":1835010,\"name\":\"SKIRTS\",\"nameEn\":\"SKIRTS\",\"shortDescription\":null,\"description\":\"Skirts are an essential piece that can be worn regardless of the occasion or time of year. Depending on the accessories and the type of footwear they are paired with, they can adapt to any style and dress code. Short skirts offer the possibility of creating an infinite number of outfits when paired with ankle boots that elevate the look in a matter of seconds; a long skirt is also ideal for creating original looks, providing the perfect combination for a wedding look when paired with a blouse and jeweled heels. A black skirt, on the other hand, is the ultimate embodiment of timelessness in a woman's wardrobe: one of the most versatile pieces that adapts to all styles and can be worn to create a wide variety of outfits.\\n\\nFrom miniskirts to long denim skirts, Massimo Dutti offers flattering silhouettes in high-quality fabrics that will become the best allies of any woman who appreciates sophistication and comfort in equal measure. Pleated skirts, characterised by their defined pleats, are very versatile and can be combined in many different ways. On a more casual note, a pair of trainers with a pleated skirt can add a twist to an outfit perfect for everyday wear. Wearing a pleated skirt with ankle boots is also a brilliant way to create sophisticated everyday outfits.

In addition, wearing a mini skirt with tights and ankle boots is one of the best ideas to add a touch of elegance and flair to your outfit.

Depending on the accessories and the type of footwear they are paired with, they can adapt to any style and dress code. Short skirts offer the possibility of creating an infinite number of outfits when paired with ankle boots that elevate the look in a matter of seconds; a long skirt is also ideal for creating original looks, providing the perfect combination for a wedding look when paired with a blouse and jeweled heels. A black skirt, on the other hand, is the ultimate embodiment of timelessness in a woman's wardrobe: one of the most versatile pieces that adapts to all styles and can be worn to create a wide variety of outfits.\\n\\nFrom miniskirts to long denim skirts, Massimo Dutti offers flattering silhouettes in high-quality fabrics that will become the best allies of any woman who appreciates sophistication and comfort in equal measure. Pleated skirts, characterised by their defined pleats, are very versatile and can be combined in many different ways. On a more casual note, a pair of trainers with a pleated skirt can add a twist to an outfit perfect for everyday wear. Wearing a pleated skirt with ankle boots is also a brilliant way to create sophisticated everyday outfits. For its part, the pleated skirt has sufficient flair to elevate the look to aesthetic levels with a certain old-school feel and a refined touch.\\n\\nMassimo Dutti also includes the sarong skirt, which is as original as it is flattering for creating an infinite number of looks. From the most classic version to designs that reinvent this option such as the printed or knotted sarong skirt, they can be paired with all types of footwear and, at the same time, stylise and refine the outfit. In its most chic version, the ruffled mini skirt makes the waist perfectly defined, while volume at the hem helps create a curvaceous silhouette. In addition, wearing a mini skirt with tights and ankle boots is one of the best ideas to add a touch of elegance and flair to your outfit. A leather midi skirt, paired with slim heels and an elegant blouse, creates the perfect combo for when the occasion calls for a more tailored ensemble.\\n\\nDenim skirts are magnetic because of their versatility: they are timeless, can be worn all year round and go with absolutely anything in your wardrobe. A long denim skirt and a white shirt make up one of the most classic —and infallible— pairings of the season. With a hippie aesthetic and a bohemian spirit, a tie dye skirt has the potential to become the absolute star of the look. For more casual dates, a long satin skirt in this print is the ideal choice. Additionally, a more romantic version of this piece is the floral printed skirt, a versatile garment for both daytime and evening looks.\",\"keywords\":null,\"secondaryTitle\":\"Skirts that are stylish and versatile\",\"secondaryDescription\":\"\"}},{\"id\":1748279,\"name\":\"BLAZERS\",\"nameEn\":\"BLAZERS\",\"shortDescription\":null,\"description\":\"Inspired by menswear, the women's blazer has a strong structure that gives elegance and strength to any style, making it the ideal alternative to complement any sophisticated look, regardless of the occasion.Therefore, it needs a perfect base, with clean cuts and impeccable stitching. As a garment that demands a perfect fit, the Massimo Dutti women's blazer has been crafted to perfection with high quality materials to achieve the most flattering result. And with a strong, distinctive design, it exudes style by itself as well as when worn as part of an ensemble, making it an essential in any wardrobe.Although blazers are a very structured garment, there is still room for interpretation of this pattern. Therefore, one can find alternatives that adapt to any personal preference, such as the double-breasted or the single-breasted blazer. Although the former is a modern style, the vintage touch remains present and is particularly evident when the buttons are fastened. On the other hand, the latter is a perfect blank canvas on which to combine garments and accessories, playing with the fastening or leaving it open.This jacket's magnetism is enhanced by the many fabric options in this collection. At the pinnacle of style are the women's leather blazer and the Nappa leather blazer. Both are modern takes on this iconic garment and can be worn with a number of other pieces in a variety of textures, such as jeans when the occasion calls for a more casual look. And thanks to the versatility of this material, denim blazers are also a safe bet, sophisticated and always ready for casual events.On the other hand, this garment can be worn even in seasons with warmer temperatures by choosing a model in a soft, cool and breathable fabric. The linen blazer —made from this highly durable natural fibre— maintains the interior temperature without losing the style and sober lines of its design. Linen also adds a delicate, romantic touch, which is emphasised by pairing it with a pair of sandals, either flat or heeled.Meanwhile, over the past seasons, the waistcoat has become a fashion favourite in all its variations. The blazer pattern has been reinvented to give way to the blazer waistcoat, which can be worn as a main top or layered with other garments such as a turtleneck jumper or shirt.From formal events to more casual occasions, one can always rely on the impeccable silhouette of the women's blazer for a more sophisticated look. Even in more urban fabrics such as denim or leather, the refined pattern of this garment adds a refined touch to any ensemble and instantly elevates any outfit.\",\"keywords\":null,\"key\":\"WOMEN_V_FAM_BLAZERS\",\"numberOfProducts\":null,\"type\":\"22\",\"viewCategoryId\":0,\"subcategories\":[{\"id\":2103777,\"name\":\"BLUE BLAZERS\",\"nameEn\":\"BLUE BLAZERS\",\"shortDescription\":null,\"description\":\"Discover classic, high-quality garments in Massimo Dutti's collection of blue blazers for women.

The eminently feminine tailoring is gaining ground, and as a result, Massimo Dutti's collection includes women's suits with new materials and shapes, associated with different social and relatively formal contexts, which has sealed the acceptability of trousers as an alternative to the skirt-jacket suit or dress. The best thing about the two-piece coordinated look is that it achieves an impeccable look without complications and, moreover, it allows for different combinations using each garment separately. The jacket and trouser suit has been adapting to cultural changes and its reign on the streets and in women's wardrobes is a fact.Sartorial in style, halfway between smart and casual, the suit jacket is one of those classics that reinvents itself with each season's trends. A perfect choice is to pair this piece with a good pair of stilettos, a simple top and a pair of elegant, masculine, tailored trousers to polish off the look. Leather designs are perfect for elevating an outfit in a matter of seconds. This is why the latest collection also includes the leather peg trouser, one of the star materials of the last few seasons, which becomes an elegant, feminine and sophisticated variation to create office outfits in which the fabric becomes the absolute protagonist.Thanks to the originality of its fabric, the wool suit jacket exudes elegance and power. Wool suit trousers are also included in the latest collection and can be worn to achieve any look with a fantastic result.In neutral shades, a navy blue suit jacket, in a pure and minimalist aesthetic, is perfect for both casual and more elaborate looks.

The most comprehensive even include a double carry handle, making this design an adaptable piece that can be worn in different styles depending on the occasion. Halfway between a satchel bag and a shoulder bag, the bucket bag recaptures the romantic, bohemian aesthetic of the 70s and is usually presented with an adjustable drawstring closure and details.Thanks to new technologies, nowadays everything fits on a smartphone. This is why small bags are becoming increasingly popular. With room for a mobile phone and little else, the pochette bag, handbag or clutch bag is a stylish yet practical accessory. Whether handheld or tucked under the arm, Massimo Dutti's pochette bags are a sophisticated detail and look even more elegant when complemented with a pair of high heels. At the more minimalist end of the spectrum, mobile phone cases have earned a place in the women's handbag section thanks to the incorporation of leather handles and finishes.The classic party bag, or clutch bag, is no longer a bag worn exclusively on special occasions, and is increasingly claiming its place in more informal gatherings, such as an impromptu dinner or a networking event.

However, within the same breath of acting as a useful item, it can perfectly go hand in hand with having an aesthetic appearance. With this thought in mind, the selection was born aiming to bring both aspects together and offer fashionable belts with timeless and quality designs that respond to the diverse needs of today's women.

For example, if you are going to create an outfit using a silver necklace, rings, earrings, and bracelets, and combine it with a belt that has a buckle with the same tone, you will get an unbeatable aesthetic, much like in gold if that is the case. To subtract the elements of jewellery while still achieving the same impact can be made all the difference by using chain belts.

In a similar way, women's wallets fulfill a dual purpose in which practicality and style both have a place. Massimo Dutti's women's belts are items that hold a certain level of functionality in addition to having an extremely meticulous and elegant appearance that perfectly complements looks from professional and formal to more casual ones. In the same sense, other accessories such as sunglasses, watches and women's hats are of similar character: they are all pieces designed to fulfill needs such as sun protection or checking the time, but at the same time can ooze style and influence different outfits. Meanwhile, when the temperatures drop, Massimo Dutti's women's scarves, gloves, and hats are unbeatable when an extra dose of warmth is required with a subtly distinctive touch that creates a sophisticated quality winter look. On the purely aesthetic side, it is women's jewellery that stands out, of course. Among these accessories, women's earrings hold a particular characteristic not only affecting the clothes they are worn with but also allowing them to influence the face due to their proximity to this area. Therefore, when choosing earrings, it is important to consider whether you want to add a luminous touch, in which case opting for a sparkly option would be ideal.On the other hand, if a balanced and stylish effect is pursued long earring designs would make a winning bet. Women's necklaces are other accessories that must be considered with various factors dramatically affecting the look. Being they are placed in a visible area and are close to the garments dressing the upper body, it is necessary to consider whether you prefer to look for a minimalist look, a soft accent that unites the outfit, or a spotlight that stands out.\",\"keywords\":null,\"secondaryTitle\":\"Delicate and elegant accessories for women\",\"secondaryDescription\":\"\"}},{\"id\":2023007,\"name\":\"JEWELLERY\",\"nameEn\":\"JEWELLERY\",\"shortDescription\":\"Jewellery\",\"description\":\"Accessories make a difference and elevate a look instantly, especially jewellery.

jumpers make all the difference in a man's wardrobe when it comes to the quality of the fabric they are made from. Massimo Dutti's men's jumpers are a versatile garment which can be the centrepiece of any look. This men's jumper collection embodies high quality, as it values the quality of the materials used in each garment. Fabrics such as cotton, wool and cashmere are characterised by their timelessness and are ideal to build the basis of any man's wardrobe. The men's roll neck jumper is the epitome of elegance; adding this garment to your wardrobe adds a touch of sophistication to any ensemble you pair it with. Wear it as part of a formal outfit by layering it underneath a blazer. This outfit is perfect for adding a different twist to the classic work look of a shirt and jacket, and it is also the best ally against cold weather. Choosing a black men's jumper as the base, this same combination can be turned into a truly unique evening look. When it comes to everyday wear, it is important to choose functional garments for easier decision making. A knitted jumper can be a good wardrobe staple to wear with any trousers, from jeans to chinos. Another great choice is a white jumper, given that it complements any classic colour in a man's wardrobe. It can even be used to tone down the intensity of patterned trousers or to create on-trend total looks in lighter shades. Another practical idea for wearing a knitted jumper to work is to combine a jumper with a shirt. Taking advantage of the elegant details of the classic shirt is a smart choice to elevate the style of this look. Choosing a men's zip-up jumper adds a genuine touch to the look, and those with a mock neck are a safe bet for a slightly cooler look. Another more classic alternative is the V-neck jumper, which is the optimal choice for highlighting the collar of a shirt. Furthermore, this type of collar creates a slimming effect thanks to the continuity of the design towards the chest. Fabric selection is vital for choosing the right jumper for you. For example, a men's wool jumper is an excellent choice to wear as a single garment and avoid layering. Wool is a robust fabric with a great ability to protect against cold weather. However, if softness is your main requirement, cashmere is the winning choice, a fabric delicate to the touch that will stand the test of time —the ideal investment for creating a good wardrobe. Apart from being worn during the colder months, a thin jumper can be the ideal companion in milder climates. And even in the warmer months, a thin jumper could be a perfect choice for evenings by the sea.\",\"keywords\":null,\"key\":\"MEN_V_FAM_JUMPERS\",\"numberOfProducts\":null,\"type\":\"22\",\"viewCategoryId\":1736768,\"subcategories\":[{\"id\":1736768,\"name\":\"VIEW ALL\",\"nameEn\":\"VIEW ALL\",\"shortDescription\":null,\"description\":\"Men's jumpers make all the difference in a man's wardrobe when it comes to the quality of the fabric they are made from.

Massimo Dutti's men's jumpers are a versatile garment which can be the centrepiece of any look. This men's jumper collection embodies high quality, as it values the quality of the materials used in each garment. Fabrics such as cotton, wool and cashmere are characterised by their timelessness and are ideal to build the basis of any man's wardrobe. The men's roll neck jumper is the epitome of elegance; adding this garment to your wardrobe adds a touch of sophistication to any ensemble you pair it with. Wear it as part of a formal outfit by layering it underneath a blazer. This outfit is perfect for adding a different twist to the classic work look of a shirt and jacket, and it is also the best ally against cold weather. Choosing a black men's jumper as the base, this same combination can be turned into a truly unique evening look. When it comes to everyday wear, it is important to choose functional garments for easier decision making. A knitted jumper can be a good wardrobe staple to wear with any trousers, from jeans to chinos. Another great choice is a white jumper, given that it complements any classic colour in a man's wardrobe. It can even be used to tone down the intensity of patterned trousers or to create on-trend total looks in lighter shades. Another practical idea for wearing a knitted jumper to work is to combine a jumper with a shirt. Taking advantage of the elegant details of the classic shirt is a smart choice to elevate the style of this look. Choosing a men's zip-up jumper adds a genuine touch to the look, and those with a mock neck are a safe bet for a slightly cooler look. Another more classic alternative is the V-neck jumper, which is the optimal choice for highlighting the collar of a shirt. Furthermore, this type of collar creates a slimming effect thanks to the continuity of the design towards the chest. Fabric selection is vital for choosing the right jumper for you. For example, a men's wool jumper is an excellent choice to wear as a single garment and avoid layering. Wool is a robust fabric with a great ability to protect against cold weather. However, if softness is your main requirement, cashmere is the winning choice, a fabric delicate to the touch that will stand the test of time —the ideal investment for creating a good wardrobe. Apart from being worn during the colder months, a thin jumper can be the ideal companion in milder climates. And even in the warmer months, a thin jumper could be a perfect choice for evenings by the sea.\",\"keywords\":null,\"secondaryTitle\":\"\",\"secondaryDescription\":\"\"}},{\"id\":1529555,\"name\":\"CARDIGANS\",\"nameEn\":\"CARDIGANS\",\"shortDescription\":null,\"description\":\"The knit is an infallible fabric that is a must-have in any fashion repertoire, and a men's cardigan is a garment not to be missed from any man's fundamental wardrobe.

Its straight-line structure allows overlaying on top of heavier outfits whilst maintaining freedom of movement. Although their initial purpose is to protect from lower temperatures, warm coats are not the only items to star in this collection. Massimo Dutti's selection presents endless types of coats that adapt to any temperature in the most refined way whilst maintaining subtle elegance incorporating detailing that transforms the garments and provides them with a unique touch.At Massimo Dutti we know that dressing up warmly forms a part of an elevated style that invites you to go out on the streets. For that reason, a grey coat will never be excluded from our selections, as it is an basic garment that makes up a pristine executive look. It provides versatility and allows achieving a balance between the suit, tie, and shirt, thanks to its fabric quality and cut. On the other hand, Massimo Dutti's parka for men combines perfectly with casual looks but also with formal outfits. Cut in a simple and functional way, this garment stands out for providing a touch of sophistication to the modern man who wishes to look elegant at any given moment.Practical, functional and on-trend with any generation, the padded vest is a classic yet incredibly contemporary piece. This refined-looking garment can be integrated with any layers without sacrificing aesthetics, under blazers, coats, thick wool overcoats; or, vice versa, over shirts, jumpers, and blazers. Regarding its practicality, the padded vest has gone from its mere protective role to becoming a masculine basic due to the freedom of movement it offers and its ability to combine technicality with casualness.When it comes to creating garments for dressing a sophisticated man with extra doses of style, Massimo Dutti's greatest specialities are classic elegance and contemporary versatility. Therefore, among the outer garment options is the trench coat, a classic coat that never goes out of fashion thanks to its practicality, comfort, and ability to adapt to anything that presents itself. Depending on the occasion, the trench coat is synonymous with timelessness and sophistication and perfectly combines with more formal or casual outfits. Its pattern has adapted itself to the change of times without ever losing its essence: side pockets, crossed front closure with buttons and adjustable belt with a matching tone buckle.Following traditional tailoring lines, an authentic double-breasted jacket is a piece that cannot be missed in any men's wardrobe. Much characterized by its double-buttoned fastening, it is a sure bet to create a complete nautical-inspired look if worn over a turtleneck jumper.

Perfect for any occasion.\",\"mainHeader\":\"Men’s coats\",\"longDescription\":\"A classic British coat adored by stylish businessmen; the overcoat never fails as a warming garment that perfectly completes a formal suit. Its straight-line structure allows overlaying on top of heavier outfits whilst maintaining freedom of movement. Although their initial purpose is to protect from lower temperatures, warm coats are not the only items to star in this collection. Massimo Dutti's selection presents endless types of coats that adapt to any temperature in the most refined way whilst maintaining subtle elegance incorporating detailing that transforms the garments and provides them with a unique touch.At Massimo Dutti we know that dressing up warmly forms a part of an elevated style that invites you to go out on the streets. For that reason, a grey coat will never be excluded from our selections, as it is an basic garment that makes up a pristine executive look. It provides versatility and allows achieving a balance between the suit, tie, and shirt, thanks to its fabric quality and cut. On the other hand, Massimo Dutti's parka for men combines perfectly with casual looks but also with formal outfits. Cut in a simple and functional way, this garment stands out for providing a touch of sophistication to the modern man who wishes to look elegant at any given moment.Practical, functional and on-trend with any generation, the padded vest is a classic yet incredibly contemporary piece. This refined-looking garment can be integrated with any layers without sacrificing aesthetics, under blazers, coats, thick wool overcoats; or, vice versa, over shirts, jumpers, and blazers. Regarding its practicality, the padded vest has gone from its mere protective role to becoming a masculine basic due to the freedom of movement it offers and its ability to combine technicality with casualness.When it comes to creating garments for dressing a sophisticated man with extra doses of style, Massimo Dutti's greatest specialities are classic elegance and contemporary versatility. Therefore, among the outer garment options is the trench coat, a classic coat that never goes out of fashion thanks to its practicality, comfort, and ability to adapt to anything that presents itself. Depending on the occasion, the trench coat is synonymous with timelessness and sophistication and perfectly combines with more formal or casual outfits. Its pattern has adapted itself to the change of times without ever losing its essence: side pockets, crossed front closure with buttons and adjustable belt with a matching tone buckle.Following traditional tailoring lines, an authentic double-breasted jacket is a piece that cannot be missed in any men's wardrobe. Much characterized by its double-buttoned fastening, it is a sure bet to create a complete nautical-inspired look if worn over a turtleneck jumper. When combined with a shirt and blazer or with a jumper, it can enhance any outfit in a matter of seconds.\",\"keywords\":null,\"secondaryTitle\":\"Stylish coats for men\",\"secondaryDescription\":\"\"}},{\"id\":2202964,\"name\":\"DOWN JACKETS & PUFFER JACKETS\",\"nameEn\":\"DOWN JACKETS & PUFFER JACKETS\",\"shortDescription\":null,\"description\":null,\"keywords\":null,\"key\":\"MEN_V_FAM_PUFFER_DOWN_JACKETS\",\"numberOfProducts\":null,\"type\":\"22\",\"viewCategoryId\":0,\"subcategories\":[],\"attachments\":[{\"id\":\"503951\",\"name\":\"STORE_MODE\",\"path\":\"STORE_MODE\",\"type\":\"STORE_MODE\"},{\"id\":\"560952\",\"name\":\"hide_shop_from_PLP\",\"path\":\"hide_shop_from_PLP\",\"type\":\"LABEL\"},{\"id\":\"562451\",\"name\":\"hide_PLP_title_APPS\",\"path\":\"hide_PLP_title_APPS\",\"type\":\"LABEL\"}],\"sequence\":513,\"oldIds\":[],\"categoryUrl\":\"men/jackets/down-jackets-n1529\",\"categoryUrlTranslations\":[],\"seoCategory\":{\"name\":\"DOWN JACKETS & PUFFER JACKETS\",\"title\":\"DOWN JACKETS & PUFFER JACKETS\",\"metaDescription\":\"DOWN JACKETS & PUFFER JACKETS\",\"mainHeader\":\"DOWN JACKETS & PUFFER JACKETS\",\"longDescription\":null,\"keywords\":null,\"secondaryTitle\":\"\",\"secondaryDescription\":\"\"}},{\"id\":2014019,\"name\":\"LEATHER JACKETS\",\"nameEn\":\"LEATHER JACKETS\",\"shortDescription\":\"Leather jackets\",\"description\":\"Massimo Dutti renders homage to men's leather jackets by presenting a selection of leather jackets that are all about quality, durability and a superb touch of style.Men's leather jackets date back to the early 20th century, although the different styles that exist today have many different origins and became popular decades later.

Elegance and class are guaranteed in all three, the only difference between them being the different silhouettes of each. The most fitted design is found in slim-fit trousers, which can be worn paired with slim-fit blazers. Meanwhile, regular fit trousers adopt a straight shape and stand a little further away from the body for a more classic touch, making them the ideal companion for a slightly more generous blazer. Somewhere in between are tapered-fit trousers, which taper slightly from the knee. By integrating features of the two previous styles, the latter cut can work as well with a slim blazer as with a more casual, relaxed jacket.And while the cuts offer variety to suit all preferences, trouser styles certainly do as well. The collection includes premium denim jeans for everyday wear, as well as versatile 5-pocket trousers. Thanks to their timeless washes and colours, they can effortlessly stand in for dress trousers for a twist on the typical office look. The selection also features chino trousers, which are suitable for all kinds of outfits and work for a wide variety of occasions. And for smart engagements that call for a shirt and blazer, and perhaps a tie, Massimo Dutti offers dress trousers in a range of classic, timeless colours, where comfort and style lie in their impeccable cut and craftsmanship from the finest quality fabrics.At the more casual end of the spectrum are styles such as cargo trousers, which feature mid-thigh flap pockets inspired by military clothing. However, in Massimo Dutti's models you can always expect that elegant touch befitting of a well-dressed man. The casual trousers section also includes Bermuda shorts, a must-have style for the warmer months that can be worn with a T-shirt and trainers or with a shirt and boat shoes for a leisurewear look that stands out from the crowd. And when the temperature rises, linen trousers for men are the perfect choice.

Elegance and class are guaranteed in all three, the only difference between them being the different silhouettes of each. The most fitted design is found in slim-fit trousers, which can be worn paired with slim-fit blazers. Meanwhile, regular fit trousers adopt a straight shape and stand a little further away from the body for a more classic touch, making them the ideal companion for a slightly more generous blazer. Somewhere in between are tapered-fit trousers, which taper slightly from the knee. By integrating features of the two previous styles, the latter cut can work as well with a slim blazer as with a more casual, relaxed jacket.And while the cuts offer variety to suit all preferences, trouser styles certainly do as well. The collection includes premium denim jeans for everyday wear, as well as versatile 5-pocket trousers. Thanks to their timeless washes and colours, they can effortlessly stand in for dress trousers for a twist on the typical office look. The selection also features chino trousers, which are suitable for all kinds of outfits and work for a wide variety of occasions. And for smart engagements that call for a shirt and blazer, and perhaps a tie, Massimo Dutti offers dress trousers in a range of classic, timeless colours, where comfort and style lie in their impeccable cut and craftsmanship from the finest quality fabrics.At the more casual end of the spectrum are styles such as cargo trousers, which feature mid-thigh flap pockets inspired by military clothing. However, in Massimo Dutti's models you can always expect that elegant touch befitting of a well-dressed man. The casual trousers section also includes Bermuda shorts, a must-have style for the warmer months that can be worn with a T-shirt and trainers or with a shirt and boat shoes for a leisurewear look that stands out from the crowd. And when the temperature rises, linen trousers for men are the perfect choice. Thanks to their lightweight fabric, they provide coolness and comfort, allowing for exceptional outfits when paired with the right items, such as a blazer in the same fabric, a light shirt and sophisticated espadrilles.Available in every possible cut and style —from the classic straight-cut jeans that are a wardrobe staple to the most refined suit trousers, from the versatile chinos to the stylish 5-pocket trousers— the Massimo Dutti collection is based on variety and the best materials to guarantee a flattering, comfortable and durable garment.\",\"keywords\":null,\"secondaryTitle\":\"\",\"secondaryDescription\":\"\"}},{\"id\":2163890,\"name\":\"JEANS\",\"nameEn\":\"JEANS\",\"shortDescription\":null,\"description\":\"When it comes to jeans, it's important to consider the fit that best suits your body type and preference. From straight jeans to slim fit jeans, this Massimo Dutti's denim collection adapts to a variety of men's silhouettes. Denim is at the heart of most men's wardrobe and, for this reason, it is a wardrobe staple.\\n\\nTapered jeans are one of the winning options for revamping workwear or for creating more casual outfits. This cut is a cross between wide leg and skinny jeans and has been a staple of urban looks for several seasons thanks to its flattering silhouette. Slightly looser at the waist and thighs and narrower at the bottom of the leg, they are ideal for wearing comfortably with trainers, boat shoes, hoodies and all types of casual outfits. The classic blue denim —with lighter and darker washes— includes the regular fit trousers, for those who prefer a loose fit all the way down the leg. These trousers might be the cut that best adapts to every style and shape, as they are one of the most basic and classic cuts. They are simple, discreet and suitable for any occasion. However, if you want to play with creating different looks, the starting point is in the selection of footwear. For more elegant looks, loafers without socks can be a very interesting option. And if the jeans are classic blue denim, you can combine everything from dark brown ankle boots to classic white trainers.\\n\\nAnd to get the most out of ankle boots, there's nothing quite like pairing them with bootcut jeans. This type of cut was designed specifically to be worn with footwear that makes a statement, however nowadays it has become popular to pair them with casual trainers and a basic T-shirt.\\n\\nMassimo Dutti offers versions of slim and skinny jeans beyond the classic denim blue. Black or grey jeans can be the ideal base for both casual and smart casual everyday looks. When it comes to skinny jeans, a touch of stretch is added to the fabric for all-day comfort and freedom of movement. Men's white jeans are also a favourite season after season thanks to their ability to create bright, urban looks. The key to wearing them is to give special attention to shoes and opting for neutral colours for the tops. On the other hand, if you are looking for a total white look, a white shirt with rolled-up sleeves will complete the look impeccably.\",\"keywords\":null,\"key\":\"MEN_V_FAM_JEANS\",\"numberOfProducts\":null,\"type\":\"22\",\"viewCategoryId\":911172,\"subcategories\":[{\"id\":911172,\"name\":\"VIEW ALL\",\"nameEn\":\"VIEW ALL\",\"shortDescription\":null,\"description\":\"When it comes to jeans, it's important to consider the fit that best suits your body type and preference.

Slightly looser at the waist and thighs and narrower at the bottom of the leg, they are ideal for wearing comfortably with trainers, boat shoes, hoodies and all types of casual outfits. The classic blue denim —with lighter and darker washes— includes the regular fit trousers, for those who prefer a loose fit all the way down the leg. These trousers might be the cut that best adapts to every style and shape, as they are one of the most basic and classic cuts. They are simple, discreet and suitable for any occasion. However, if you want to play with creating different looks, the starting point is in the selection of footwear. For more elegant looks, loafers without socks can be a very interesting option. And if the jeans are classic blue denim, you can combine everything from dark brown ankle boots to classic white trainers.\\n\\nAnd to get the most out of ankle boots, there's nothing quite like pairing them with bootcut jeans. This type of cut was designed specifically to be worn with footwear that makes a statement, however nowadays it has become popular to pair them with casual trainers and a basic T-shirt.\\n\\nMassimo Dutti offers versions of slim and skinny jeans beyond the classic denim blue. Black or grey jeans can be the ideal base for both casual and smart casual everyday looks. When it comes to skinny jeans, a touch of stretch is added to the fabric for all-day comfort and freedom of movement. Men's white jeans are also a favourite season after season thanks to their ability to create bright, urban looks. The key to wearing them is to give special attention to shoes and opting for neutral colours for the tops. On the other hand, if you are looking for a total white look, a white shirt with rolled-up sleeves will complete the look impeccably.\",\"keywords\":null,\"key\":\"MEN_V_FAM_JEANS_VIEW_ALL\",\"numberOfProducts\":null,\"type\":\"22\",\"viewCategoryId\":0,\"subcategories\":[],\"attachments\":[{\"id\":\"503951\",\"name\":\"STORE_MODE\",\"path\":\"STORE_MODE\",\"type\":\"STORE_MODE\"},{\"id\":\"551460\",\"name\":\"show_category_products_1727620\",\"path\":\"show_category_products_1727620\",\"type\":\"LABEL\"},{\"id\":\"554452\",\"name\":\"FORCE_VIEW_STUDIO\",\"path\":\"FORCE_VIEW_STUDIO\",\"type\":\"LABEL\"},{\"id\":\"554951\",\"name\":\"SHOW_CATEGORY_PRODUCTS\",\"path\":\"SHOW_CATEGORY_PRODUCTS\",\"type\":\"LABEL\"},{\"id\":\"560451\",\"name\":\"SHOW_SISTERS\",\"path\":\"SHOW_SISTERS\",\"type\":\"LABEL\"},{\"id\":\"562451\",\"name\":\"hide_PLP_title_APPS\",\"path\":\"hide_PLP_title_APPS\",\"type\":\"LABEL\"}],\"sequence\":530,\"oldIds\":[],\"categoryUrl\":\"men/trousers/jeans-n1405\",\"categoryUrlTranslations\":[],\"seoCategory\":{\"name\":\"VIEW ALL\",\"title\":\"Men's Jeans\",\"metaDescription\":\"VIEW ALL\",\"mainHeader\":\"Jeans for Men\",\"longDescription\":\"When it comes to jeans, it's important to consider the fit that best suits your body type and preference.

From straight jeans to slim fit jeans, this Massimo Dutti's denim collection adapts to a variety of men's silhouettes. Denim is at the heart of most men's wardrobe and, for this reason, it is a wardrobe staple.\\n\\nTapered jeans are one of the winning options for revamping workwear or for creating more casual outfits. This cut is a cross between wide leg and skinny jeans and has been a staple of urban looks for several seasons thanks to its flattering silhouette. Slightly looser at the waist and thighs and narrower at the bottom of the leg, they are ideal for wearing comfortably with trainers, boat shoes, hoodies and all types of casual outfits. The classic blue denim —with lighter and darker washes— includes the regular fit trousers, for those who prefer a loose fit all the way down the leg. These trousers might be the cut that best adapts to every style and shape, as they are one of the most basic and classic cuts. They are simple, discreet and suitable for any occasion. However, if you want to play with creating different looks, the starting point is in the selection of footwear. For more elegant looks, loafers without socks can be a very interesting option. And if the jeans are classic blue denim, you can combine everything from dark brown ankle boots to classic white trainers.\\n\\nAnd to get the most out of ankle boots, there's nothing quite like pairing them with bootcut jeans. This type of cut was designed specifically to be worn with footwear that makes a statement, however nowadays it has become popular to pair them with casual trainers and a basic T-shirt.\\n\\nMassimo Dutti offers versions of slim and skinny jeans beyond the classic denim blue. Black or grey jeans can be the ideal base for both casual and smart casual everyday looks. When it comes to skinny jeans, a touch of stretch is added to the fabric for all-day comfort and freedom of movement. Men's white jeans are also a favourite season after season thanks to their ability to create bright, urban looks. The key to wearing them is to give special attention to shoes and opting for neutral colours for the tops. On the other hand, if you are looking for a total white look, a white shirt with rolled-up sleeves will complete the look impeccably.\",\"keywords\":null,\"secondaryTitle\":\"\",\"secondaryDescription\":\"\"}},{\"id\":2164385,\"name\":\"SHIRTS\",\"nameEn\":\"SHIRTS\",\"shortDescription\":null,\"description\":\"Shirts are the cornerstone of a man's wardrobe, which is why Massimo Dutti's collection of men's shirts offers different designs carefully crafted in high quality fabrics.

Thus, adding one of Massimo Dutti’s designs to a man’s repertoire is an intelligent choice that ensures comfort and an infinity of different outfits.Stylish men have always relied on this timeless pattern that can adopt different versions, always with the utmost class. The multiple-striped shirt stands out because of its high number of stripes, almost invisible when far away but unfolding exquisitely before the eyes when taking a closer look. Stripes lovers will find many options in Massimo Dutti’s selection, including the wide-striped shirt, which is the boldest version of this pattern and can create the illusion of a bigger torso. Last but not least, there are pieces whose stripes aren’t thin or wide but fall between the two alternatives to offer a versatile middle ground. The striped shirt also allows a wide variety of hues. For instance, the most classic brown, grey, or blue-striped shirts can integrate effortlessly into a suited look, even more so when considering a slim-fit shirt that can build spectacular executive looks to stand out during important meetings. Regarding light-coloured palettes, linen shirts are one of the favourites, of course, without forgetting the basic striped cotton shirts. A striped linen shirt in soft blue, green and even red is a must-have for the warmer months, and it adds a fresh and stylish touch to every ensemble. It can be worn with a pair of trousers in any pastel hue in the morning and a blazer in the evening to achieve a flawless look throughout the day. On the most casual occasions, the two-tone striped shirt mixes two different colours, being the perfect companion for jeans and chinos.Stripes are the pattern that never sleeps, even at night. This design adapts to every night event with colour combinations perfect for the twilight hours, like the white and navy thin striped shirt.

This versatile garment is easily adaptable to both smart and casual situations.\\n\\nThis seemingly simple men's garment has a number of styles in a variety of silhouettes to suit every occasion and personal preference. The regular fit shirt, which features a classic cut that doesn't quite cling to the body or fit too loosely, is perfect for many events as well as everyday looks. A more tailored alternative is the slim-fit shirt, with a sartorial silhouette that, paired with the perfect tailoring of its design, makes the garment look tailored and is the ideal choice for smart and professional situations. The short-sleeved shirt, on the other hand, is at the pinnacle of casual styling, with its relaxed lines making it easy to wear and a perfect fit for laid-back, casual outfits.\\n\\nWhen it comes to fabrics, the cotton shirt is one of the most representative pieces of the smart wardrobe as it goes perfectly with all types of suits, chinos and jeans. On the other hand, the linen shirt is a lightweight alternative ideal for holiday looks. Thanks to its breathable fabric, it is a great wardrobe staple when temperatures in the city rise, or for casual outfits when spending a nice day by the sea or enjoying the city. On the other hand, the herringbone patterned shirt is one of the best examples of a classic design with an original twist, adding a different touch that makes the difference when worn with other plain garments and becomes the star of the look.\\n\\nDenim is also featured in a selection with a wide range of options in denim shirts. The best thing about this material lies in its great versatility, fitting perfectly with garments that elevate it and give it a sophisticated touch, or with more denim pieces that enhance its versatility.\\n\\nOne of the most famous and versatile models is by far the Oxford shirt. Originally named after the fabric used to make it, it is generally associated with a smart casual, sophisticated style.\\n\\nHowever, if you want to incorporate a little twist into your styling, consider a patterned shirt. The striped shirt is a dynamic garment that can be used to create great looks for professional and smart environments. Nautical-inspired options are more sporty and work well with sophisticated leisure looks. For a subtle casual feel, the checked shirt is a definite go-to for casual styling with jeans.\",\"keywords\":null,\"secondaryTitle\":\"Stylish Shirts for Men\",\"secondaryDescription\":\"\"}},{\"id\":2176380,\"name\":\"T-SHIRTS\",\"nameEn\":\"T-SHIRTS\",\"shortDescription\":null,\"description\":\"When it comes to a garment that goes with everything, men's T-shirts meet all the requirements: their versatility rivals that of few other garments.

And when a suit is made with the quality and attention to detail that Massimo Dutti is known for, it serves to show self-confidence and reflect the wearer's sophisticated style like no other garment can.\\n\\nChoosing a smart suit for men is a responsibility and a privilege in equal parts, and getting it right always depends on the degree of smartness of the suit, as well as the time of day and the event's venue. The dress code may call for a morning suit, tailcoat, dinner jacket or perhaps a conventional suit with a tie and polished leather shoes will suffice. Massimo Dutti's collection includes smart men's suits for the workplace or to set the style bar high for those special occasions when no wardrobe detail can be left to chance.\\n\\nMen's blue suits are always in the spotlight because they never go out of fashion and come in a variety of designs to suit all preferences, including subtle windowpane pattern or the iconic pinstripe, forever associated with the business look. For an elevated daytime look, choose a deeper blue as an alternative to the classic dark tones, although the navy blue men's suit remains one of the most popular styles for its classic elegance and timelessness.\\n\\nGrey is another favourite suit colour. And a grey suit for men allows for all sorts of combinations, with the shade of grey being what will determine whether it is more appropriate to add a light or dark shirt. The right colour combination can make or break any look, but when it comes to this garment, its relevance is even greater. As an example, a grey suit with a black shirt works best with darker shades of grey, while a suit in a light or medium shade of grey will pair well with a light blue or white shirt. Elegance is also a given with a black suit and a blue, white, grey or black shirt.\",\"keywords\":null,\"secondaryTitle\":\"Elegant Suits for Men\",\"secondaryDescription\":\"\"}},{\"id\":2147330,\"name\":\"PERSONAL TAILORING\",\"nameEn\":\"PERSONAL TAILORING\",\"shortDescription\":null,\"description\":\"Find the ideal suit in Massimo Dutti's men's tailoring collection.

Men's loafers also make an excellent choice, both for those special events and for adding a sophisticated touch to everyday looks.

There are many types of ankle boots, with men's Chelsea boots —with their distinctive tapered shape— being among the most popular. They work perfectly with slim-fit trousers, whether suit trousers or jeans, making them perfect for a wide range of occasions. Black models exude versatility, while browns are perfectly in tune with lighter coloured trousers.When it comes to creating fashionable looks, men's trainers have become an absolute must-have. They are comfortable to wear, but they have managed to steal the centre of attention due to their many other virtues. They are stylish and go well with everything from tracksuits and jeans to chinos and slacks. Since there's no look they can't pull off, they're an ideal choice for uncomplicated morning wear. For the more stylish, men's dress shoes are a great alternative to classic shoes, giving the look a stylish, contemporary twist.

In this regard, adding white men's trainers to your collection is a great idea because they go well with almost any trousers in your wardrobe.When it comes to comfort, men's sandals are another must-have. As with any footwear, the materials used, as well as their quality, are key to ensuring an elegant effect. Leather sandals add that premium touch to the look, and are perfect for everything from Bermuda shorts to dress trousers.

Dress shoes are a safe bet when the context calls for something smart. Thanks to their classic feel and unquestionable elegance, men's Oxford shoes are a symbol of smart dressing that never goes out of style. Business meetings and other important appointments require footwear that is up to the task and oxford shoes are certainly up to the task. Men's loafers also make an excellent choice, both for those special events and for adding a sophisticated touch to everyday looks. The iconic loafer embraces different styles and materials, working perfectly with a suit or with jeans and a casual shirt. Another must-have style for any shoe collection are men's boots. Versatile and hard-wearing, men's boots are ideal for dressing down or putting together a look for a special event. There are many types of ankle boots, with men's Chelsea boots —with their distinctive tapered shape— being among the most popular. They work perfectly with slim-fit trousers, whether suit trousers or jeans, making them perfect for a wide range of occasions. Black models exude versatility, while browns are perfectly in tune with lighter coloured trousers.When it comes to creating fashionable looks, men's trainers have become an absolute must-have. They are comfortable to wear, but they have managed to steal the centre of attention due to their many other virtues. They are stylish and go well with everything from tracksuits and jeans to chinos and slacks. Since there's no look they can't pull off, they're an ideal choice for uncomplicated morning wear. For the more stylish, men's dress shoes are a great alternative to classic shoes, giving the look a stylish, contemporary twist. Men's trainers can come in an infinite number of colour combinations, but it is undoubtedly the monochrome models that work best with a suit. In this regard, adding white men's trainers to your collection is a great idea because they go well with almost any trousers in your wardrobe.When it comes to comfort, men's sandals are another must-have. As with any footwear, the materials used, as well as their quality, are key to ensuring an elegant effect. Leather sandals add that premium touch to the look, and are perfect for everything from Bermuda shorts to dress trousers. Men's espadrilles are also a favourite for warmer months due to their coolness and easy-to-wear design. Whether in the shape of the traditional espadrille or with details such as the espadrille with mask, which brings them closer to the elegant loafer, espadrilles will always have a place in every man's shoe box.\",\"keywords\":null,\"secondaryTitle\":\"Footwear for Men\",\"secondaryDescription\":\"\"}},{\"id\":2163900,\"name\":\"ACCESSORIES\",\"nameEn\":\"ACCESSORIES\",\"shortDescription\":null,\"description\":\"Accessories are the ideal way to complete a look and give it a unique and more personal touch.

In this edit, <strong>Massimo Dutti's dresses</strong> are always marked by elegance, with flattering, flowing silhouettes and quality fabrics.<br/><br/> From the New York of the 80's, <strong>long dresses </strong>paired with trainers are still very much on-trend today, season after season, for their comfortable, urban-chic aesthetic. Southern American also returns in the form of <strong>dresses</strong> paired with short boots, a combination reminiscent of bohemian Californian styles. The key to the success of this ensemble is precisely the harmony created between the more forceful type of footwear in contrast with a delicate garment such as the <strong>flowing dress</strong>. <br/><br/>This collection features contrasting fabrics and textures: from the freshness and lightness of softer fabrics to the warmth and robustness of more full-bodied materials. For the former, we present the long linen and <strong>long silk dresses</strong> —both of which are considered to be the epitome of sophistication and go perfectly with <strong>sandals</strong> or<strong> ankle boots and practical handbags</strong> of any size. Meanwhile, the long <strong>poplin dress</strong> offers a totally versatile, day-to-day option suitable for any season. Moreover, it is easy to complement with other warmer or lighter garments, embracing the role of formality just as well when paired with more sober garments. Other models adaptable to a multitude of styles and looks are the knit dress and the <strong>cashmere dress</strong>.<br/><br/>Their soft textures make their quality evident at first glance, making it possible to create minimalist outfits in which less is more when it comes to a garment with an impeccable appearance. On the other hand, the more cosmopolitan designs include the <strong>long leather dress</strong> and the <strong>short dress</strong>, also<strong> in leather</strong>. In particular, the <strong>short black dress</strong> in this material has a particularly trendy character with a silhouette that does not disappoint, completely flattering and adaptable for strong and stylish looks.<br/><br/> For a more professional approach one can find a wide variety of available alternatives. For example, the <strong>long shirt dress</strong> is a simple yet comfortable choice <strong>suitable for office looks </strong>while the <strong>blazer dress</strong> is one of the best examples of elegance, and can be worn not only to business meetings but also to professional events and parties where you want to make a statement.  <br/><br/>Meanwhile, the long cross over dress —whether long or short sleeved— undeniably flatters the silhouette with a relaxed sophistication appropriate for such occasions. For this edit, the most romantic pieces are presented in dresses from the 70s. The<strong> long printed</strong>, <strong>strapless and halter-neck dresses</strong> have a boho feel to them, giving the looks that nostalgic vintage touch. Recovering designs from other decades, we also find the <strong>pleated dress,</strong> a historical garment inspired by fashion and glamour icons, which today continues to create ultra-feminine looks.</p><button class=\"ttu btn-tertiary is-flex content-center w-100\"><span class=\"leading-1 mr-4\"><svg-icon2><div><svg fill=\"none\" height=\"16\" viewbox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n",
